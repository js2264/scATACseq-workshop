## Session 1: Processing bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq reads

### Lecture 1: Bulk ATAC-seq experimental approaches 
>15'

  - Introduction to bulk ATAC-seq methods: "classic", omniATAC-seq, low input ATAC-seq, ...

### Hands-on 1: Processing bulk ATAC-seq data
>35'

  - Sequencing QC
  - Mapping reads and correcting
  - Visualizing and QC-ing the results

### Exercise 1: Inspecting bulk ATAC-seq outputs
>10'

  - Visually inspect the generated tracks and the identifed peaks
  - Get the distribution of fragment sizes over ATAC peaks. 
  - Compare this distribution to the previous one. Discuss.
